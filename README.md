The image above can be explained in terms of actors who interact with eachother and value objects.

ACTORS:
Farmers: Primary users who buy, sell, and exchange seeds. Application Creators: Responsible for the development, deployment, and maintenance of the AfrICereal application. Certification agency: Not currently implemented, responsible for certifying farmer's seeds. Application: Provides service to farmers, serviced by developers, conncets farmers with certification agencies.

VALUE EXCHANGES:
Farmers: Exchange seeds among each other and share information regarding seed types, prices, and availability. They use the application to access these exchanges and communicate. They pay the developers via the application. They provide seeds to the agencies.
Application Creators: Provide a digital platform (AfrICereal) facilitating the exchange and communication among farmers. Receive payments via the application from the farmers.
Certification agency: receive seeds from the farmers and return the certified seeds.

VALUE OBJECTS:
Seeds: Different types like sorgho, millet, and petit mil.
Information: Details about seed types, prices, and availability.
Access to Market: The application provides farmers access to a broader market.
Certification Services: Offered by the certification agencies to ensure seed quality (planned for future implementation).
Technical Support and Updates: Provided by the application creators to maintain the system functionality.
Money: payed by the farmers to allow the application to exist and be maintained.

MARKET SEGMENT:
The primary target market segment: Farmers in Rural Mali, includes those in isolated communities.
Potential Expansion to Other Regions: Future market segments as the application grows.

CONNECTIONS AND INTERACTIONS:
Farmers: Direct interactions with each other and the application.
Direct interaction with the certification agencies. Indirect interaction with the developers.
Application Creators and Farmers: Continuous interaction for feedback, updates, and support. Direct interaction with the application.
Indirect interaction with the farmers.
certification agency: Direct interaction with the farmers. Passive interaction with the application, that refers farmers more easily to the agencies.
